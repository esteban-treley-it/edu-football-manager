The game targets:
- Football fans
- Students of sports science
- Aspiring coaches
- Strategy and management players

## 2. Core Pillars

1. Tactical Depth
- Real formations and positional play
- Player roles with real behavioral impact
- Game phases: build-up, progression, final third, pressing, transitions

2. Systems Thinking
- Every decision has multi-system consequences
- Training affects injuries, morale, finances, results

3. Education Through Play
- Players learn football concepts implicitly
- Explicit learning only appears in Academy Mode

4. Long-Term Simulation
- Multi-season careers
- Player aging, decline, and development
- Club financial cycles and risk

5. Adaptive Challenge
- AI adapts to player behavior
- Forces evolution, not repetition
